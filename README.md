# Speedier
A chrome extension for intelligent video fast forwarding.

### About Speedier
Speedier is an extension designed to modify the playback rate of a video according to the activity of said video. Currently, it looks at the amplitude / gain of the video, and adjusts the playback rate accordingly. This could be highly useful when watching recordings of live lectures, where lecturers sometimes pause for thinking or dramatic effect.

### Background

This project was made for the 24-hour hackathon, [Hack&Roll 2022](https://hacknroll2022.devpost.com/). This was also our first foray into chrome extensions and web development in general. Originally, we had planned to integrate Shashwat's vision algorithm, but could not figure it out prior to the deadline. For all the reasons stated above, **please do not expect this to be anything close to a polished product**.
